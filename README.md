# redi-intro-final
Welcome to my final project for ReDi's Digitial Women Program - Intro to Computer Science.
Here you will find a website featuring some of my photography from the time when I was a student.
In the past, I had made a website to feature this work but that website has since become outdated and partially non-funtional (flash elements).
So doing my final project for ReDi gave me the opportunity to update that website.
Enjoy!
