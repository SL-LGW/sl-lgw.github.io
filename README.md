# redi-intro-final
Welcome to my final project for ReDi's Digitial Women Program - Intro to Computer Science course.
Here you will find a website feature some of my photography from the time when I was a student.
In the past, I had made a website to feature this work but the website has since become outdated and partially non-funtional (flash elements).

To begin your experience, please select welcome.html.

Enjoy!
